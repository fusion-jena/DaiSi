# [Dai:Si] - A modular framework for Dataset Search

This repository provides the source code for [Dai:Si] - a frontend framework for querying a dataset search index. The name is an abbrevation of 'Dataset Search' in its phonetic spelling.
[Dai:Si] consists of two parts: a backend server (Node Server) and a frontend (Angular application). 
The Node middleware server handles the index requests and provides a convenient API for the frontend - a modular Angular app that can be easily adjusted for a specific domain. [Dai:Si] also provides a semantic search for biological datasets. 

* [Angular app] 
* [Node Server] 

[Angular app]: https://github.com/fusion-jena/DatasetSearchUI/tree/master/angular
[Node Server]: https://github.com/fusion-jena/DatasetSearchUI/tree/master/node

## Demo

A live demo is available here: https://dev.gfbio.uni-jena.de/daisi/

The Node Server and its API is also available: https://dev.gfbio.uni-jena.de/daisi-api/api-docs/

## How to setup Dai:Si for your own index

Setting up Dai:Si for your own search index comprises a few steps that are additionally described in the [Node Server] and the [Angular app] sections.
 
1. create a new module in the NodeServer for your search index (myIndex.js) and provide a search ``/search`` function
2. add your module to the app.js file and add the new APIs to swagger
3. test the connection, e.g., (http://localhost:3000/myIndex/search, http://localhost:3000/api-docs)
4. add further function to your module if necessary, e.g., ``/suggest`` (for auto-complete function) and ``/semantic-search`` (if you want to expand the query keywords on related terms)
5. create a new component with the angular cli, e.g., ``ng generate component myIndex``
6. in ``app.components.ts`` and ``app-routing.module.ts``  add your component to the index and route arrays
7. implement your component (add the required components to the html file, add the methods to the ts file)
8. map your index fields to Dai:Siâ€™s underlying data model (create a new service, e.g., ``myIndex-preprocess-data.service.ts`` file)
9. in your new component, call the node service and pass the parameters of your custom index
10. test your new application: http://localhost:4200/myIndex
